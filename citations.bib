It is then shown that all such spaces are complete lattices whose lattice structure determines the topology --- these are the continuous lattices --- and every such lattice has the extension property. With this foundation the lattices are studied in detail with respect to projections, subspaces, embeddings, and constructions such as products, sums, function spaces, and inverse limits. The main result of the paper is a proof that every topological space can be embedded in a continuous lattice which is homeomorphic (and isomorphic) to its own function space. The function algebra of such spaces provides mathematical models for the Church-Curry $\lambda$-calculus.},

The idea is to construct a universe U and two functions such that a certain equality holds. Using this equality, we prove and disprove that a certain object in U is well-founded.},

  abstract = {Some connections between λ-calculus and category theory have been known. Among them, it has been shown by Lambek that cartesian closed categories (ccc for short) can be identified with extensional typed λ-calculus (cf. Lambek (1980), and Lambek and Scott (1986)). In this paper we introduce the notion of adjunction of semifunctors (for simplicity, we refer to this as ‘semiadjunction’) and, by the aid of this notion, we define the notion of semi cartesian closed category (semi-ccc for short). Some categorical or algebraic systems aimed to represent λ-calculus will turn out to be special cases of semi-ccc. Another intersting connection between ccc and λ-calculus is Scott's embedding of λ-theory into a ccc (cf. Scott (1980)). (This will be referred to as Scott embedding.) We will show that any semiadjunction is embeddable in an adjunction (of functors) and Scott embedding is a special case.}

Such constructions can thus be effectively formulated in the corresponding category of objects.

With these constructions available, many other properties can be efficiently developed. Superficially quite different categories, arising in geometry, topology, algebraic geometry, group representations, and set theory, all turn out to satisfy the axioms defining such a topos.},

In this paper, we show that when going into the (generally omitted) technical details, this naive model raises several unexpected difficulties related to the interpretation of the impredicative level, especially for the soundness property which is surprisingly difficult to be given a correct proof in this simple framework. We propose a way to tackle these difficulties, thus giving a (more) detailed elementary consistency proof of CC without going back to a translation to F$\omega$. We also discuss some possible alternatives and possible extensions of our construction.},
