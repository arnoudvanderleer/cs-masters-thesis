This paper presents a new approach to the needed structure on the monoid deriving from a recent analysis of the lambda calculus in terms of algebraic theory.}

  abstract  = {Starting from the topological point of view a certain wide class of To-spaces is introduced having a very strong extension property for continuous functions with values in these spaces. It is then shown that all such spaces are complete lattices whose lattice structure determines the topology --- these are the continuous lattices --- and every such lattice has the extension property. With this foundation the lattices are studied in detail with respect to projections, subspaces, embeddings, and constructions such as products, sums, function spaces, and inverse limits. The main result of the paper is a proof that every topological space can be embedded in a continuous lattice which is homeomorphic (and isomorphic) to its own function space. The function algebra of such spaces provides mathematical models for the Church-Curry $\lambda$-calculus.},

The corresponding proof terms (that have no normal form) are large. We present a shorter term of type ⊥ in the Pure Type System $\lambda$U− and analyse its reduction behaviour. The idea is to construct a universe U and two functions such that a certain equality holds. Using this equality, we prove and disprove that a certain object in U is well-founded.},
