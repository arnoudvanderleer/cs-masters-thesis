  abstract = {Any interpretation of the lambda calculus determines a composition monoid and this monoid can be equipped with structure from which the interpretation can be recovered. That is the essence of Dana Scott's account of the lambda calculus in terms of its category of retracts. This paper presents a new approach to the needed structure on the monoid deriving from a recent analysis of the lambda calculus in terms of algebraic theory.}
